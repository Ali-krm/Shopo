        <p className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
          What began as a humble leather footwear label in 2009 has since
          evolved into a well established Australian design brand best known for
          its signature timepieces and butter-soft leather bags.Â 
        </p>

        <p className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
          From their studio in Sydney, they design complementary ranges for
          work, travel and leisure. Each collection is devised in the spirit of
          the Australian lifestyle and comes in a palette of colourways inspired
          by our natural landscapes, from the richness of a desert interior to
          the soft, organic tones of bush and coast.
        </p>

        <p className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
          In everything they do, they hold to their manifesto: to magnify what
          is essential and edit out the excess.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.aboutParagraph}>
          Together with their small team, Scott and Amy take joy in creating
          accessories that enrich the everyday.
